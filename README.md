# Algorithmic Trading Project

🐍 Welcome to Algorithmic Trading!

## Quickstart

1. Deploy to a fake local network that titanoboa automatically spins up!

```bash
mox run deploy
```

2. Run tests

```
mox test
```

## Game Plan
- [ ] Deposit into Aave
- [ ] Withdraw from Aave
- [ ] Trade tokens through Uniswap

The idea is to maintain a 70/30 ratio of tokens in the portfolio,
and rebalance when the ratio deviates by more than 5%.
